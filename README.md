#AnnoMaps - Ruby on Rails Application

AnnoMaps is a project that utilizes Google Maps APIs and allows users to save maps by location address, drop pins and annotate the dropped pins with text. Users have access to a dashboard which displays all of the maps they created and the ability to select a specific map and view the associated pins with their details. 

This application is intended to allow users to refer back to the places they've traveled and revisit some of the things they found interesting about that particular location. It can also be useful when planning upcoming trips.
